## Advanced Programming Lab 4 (September 9, 2023) - C Language Problem Set

In this repository, we will exclusively use the C programming language to explore and solve various programming challenges. Below are some of the problems we'll tackle using functions:

1. **Swap Two Numbers**
   - Problem: Write a C program that swaps the values of two numbers.
   - File: `swap_two_numbers.c`

2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Problem: Write a C program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers using separate functions for each operation.
   - File: `arithmetic_operations.c`

3. **Number Divisibility Check**
   - Problem: Create a C program that takes a number as input and sends it to a function named "CheckThisNumber." The function should return 1 if the number is divisible by 5, and 0 otherwise. In the main function, print "The number is divisible by 5" if the returned value is 1, and "The number is not divisible by 5" if it's 0.
   - File: `number_divisibility_check.c`

Feel free to explore and contribute to these problem solutions using the C programming language. Happy coding!
