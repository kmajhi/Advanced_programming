<h1>Data Types</h1>
The data type is the type of data that a given variable can store. Different data types have different sizes. There are 3 types of data types in C:

<pre>Basic Data Types
Derived Data Types
User Defined Data Types
</pre>

1. Basic Data Types
Basic data types are built-in in the C programming language and are independent of any other data type. There are x types of basic data types in C:

<pre>char: Used to represent characters.
int: Used to represent integral numbers.
float: Used to represent decimal numbers up to 6-7 precision digits.
double: Used to represent decimal numbers up to 15 precision digits.
void: Used to represent the valueless entity.</pre>

Example of Basic Data Types
<pre>char c = 'a';
int integer = 24;
float f = 24.32;
double d = 24.3435;
void v;</pre>
The size of these basic data types can be modified using data type modifiers which are:

<pre>short
long
signed
unsigned</pre>
Example of Data Type Modifiers

<pre>unsigned int var1;
long double var2;
long int var3;</pre>

2. Derived Data Types
Derived data types are derived from the basic data types. There are 2 derived data types in C:

<pre>Arrays
Pointers</pre>
3. User-Defined Data Types
The user-defined data types are the data types that are defined by the programmers in their code.  There are 3 user-defined data types in C:

<pre>Structure
Union
Enumeration</pre>
